Wondershaper is _
but I worried I'd keep forgetting the name of the app whenever I needed to use it. Caffeine-Indicator gave me the idea to make an indicator for easy configuration.

Had issues with inkscape but Brian Beck helped me solve it. In summary, I made an icon in Inkscape which was a wifi tachometer. I tried using Object mask to cut the wifi icon but it would only look right on Inkscape, but it would not show in anything else. Brian used another approach which is to create a random shape at the same angle as the cut out and `Ctrl + -` to do a `Path > Difference` (Converting to path might be required before taking the difference).
