- As a kid from the 90s, I grew up along side the internet
- Graduated from Texas A&M University with BS in biology
- Worked as a react developer for 2 years

Growing up in a DIY household, I have explored many different domains such as home improvement, car maintenance, photography, videography, editing, dabbled with musical instrumentsi, and game development. I love learning from seeminly different fields because I believe it broadens my understanding of processes and helps me think outside the box. For example, there's a big overlap of the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) in science and the [Lean UX](https://webdevstudios.com/2015/05/11/lean-ux-design/#lean-ux-does-not-equal-agile-ux) cycle in the UX field.

I want to build solutions to every day problems. I believe the web is a sandbox which will allow me to do so in many different ways. Building products which people will use means to understand people's needs. I aim to improve the community's quality of life through user experience and web development.
